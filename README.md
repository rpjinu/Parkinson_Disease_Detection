Parkinson's Disease Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict Parkinson's disease using a dataset containing various attributes related to the condition. The process includes data preprocessing, model training, saving the trained model, and testing it with new input data.

#Project Structure:-
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.\
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.\
models/: Saved models after training.
scripts/: Python scripts for training and testing the model.
README.md: Project documentation.
Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:

MDVP
(Hz): Average vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP
(Hz): Maximum vocal fundamental frequency
MDVP
(Hz): Minimum vocal fundamental frequency
Jitter(%), Jitter(Abs): Measures of variation in fundamental frequency
Shimmer, Shimmer(dB): Measures of variation in amplitude
HNR: Harmonic-to-noise ratio
RPDE: Recurrence period density entropy
DFA: Detrended fluctuation analysis
spread1, spread2, D2, PPE: Various nonlinear measures
status: Health status of the subject (1 - Parkinson's, 0 - Healthy)
